# Yogabase Dart client preview

Generated with Microsoft Kiota 1.34.1 from the current Yogabase v1-preview contract. Dart output
is experimental in this generator version. Callers must provide a request adapter with the exact
Yogabase REST gateway and a project bearer-token authentication provider.

The generated REST surface includes bootstrap, signup and interactive auth endpoints, Data,
Storage, stateless Function invocation, Actor Lambda invocation, and Workflow start/cancel. The
contract returns a separate realtime origin, but this package does not yet include or qualify a
Dart/Flutter SignalR wrapper. This source preview is local, unpublished, and not
production-qualified.

## Hierarchical storage keys

Generated `objects.byKey(...)` is single-segment-only. For a logical key containing `/`, use the
authored `storageObjectForLogicalKey(...)` adapter exported from the package library. It validates
the C# key grammar, encodes each segment separately, and returns
`WithKeyItemRequestBuilder.withUrl(...)` with the resulting raw URL.

```dart
final item = storageObjectForLogicalKey(
  client.v1.storage.objects,
  requestAdapter.baseUrl!,
  'avatars/user-1/photo.png',
);
```

The adapter is authored Yogabase code, not Kiota output. Dart remains source-inspected only until
the Dart SDK is available for compilation and tests.

For `PUT`, add both required contract headers through the Kiota request configuration:
`X-Yogabase-Content-Sha256: sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` and a bounded `Idempotency-Key`. Kiota does
not emit dedicated Dart method arguments for these headers.
